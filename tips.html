                    human resources teams. In this article, I'll try to propose a brief tour of the most critical points
                    around Diversity and how we ensure it at Devlane, its benefits for the service we provide, and the
                    challenges we face.</p>

                <p class="mt-3 font18">‍

                    First, to talk about diversity is to talk about “difference.” It means that each person who joins a
                    work team has an individual trait, characteristic, perspective and ideology that englobes a group of
                    attributes, for example, Generational diversity (inclusion of different generations from Z to baby
                    boomers), Ethnic and Racial Diversity (encouraging the participation of cultural and ethnic groups,
                    respecting cultural heritage), Gender difference (variety of identities, men women, transgender,
                    non-binary entities and more), Ability differences (respect the different ability and capacity
                    conditions of each person) and differences Cultural (respect for other cultures and care for their
                    traditions).

                    ‍

                    Recognizing that social, educational, and work contexts impact each path of differences/attributes
                    is essential.

                    ‍

                    Inside Devlane, we take this reality and empower the teams throughout Latam, seeking to give rise to
                    and enrich ourselves with the differences of our Laners, who have a space to encourage, value, and
                    include all expressions of life experience, thought, and ability within our teams.

                    ‍

                    Why is it important to include diversity in work teams?

                    ‍

                    We can open doors when we collect a person's characteristics and build diverse teams because we
                    receive different insights to feed on other points of view and add value to our projects.

                    ‍

                    By including different experiences, we can make room for different ways of discussing, arguing, and
                    seeing a situation from various points of view to make the best decisions.

                    ‍

                    Creativity and innovation are stimulated, things that would not happen if they were all the same.

                    ‍

                    To see a diverse work team is to reflect a piece of society's general diversity. This is essential
                    in important companies and organizations that seek to meet the needs of a wide range of customers
                    and users.

                    ‍

                    Companies promoting diversity are more interesting since you find many talents. Therefore, your
                    contribution to staying in a workspace increases, the work climate grows, and a positive and
                    creative atmosphere is facilitated that directly impacts the employee's health, maintaining a
                    work-life balance purpose.

                    ‍

                    Prioritizing working hard on this central topic allows us to integrate different audiences and
                    markets to reach us with new ideas, comments, and preferences, reflecting a complete understanding
                    of the diverse demographic work-life needs.</p>
